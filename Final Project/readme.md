## **Project Description**

The **telecom operator Interconnect** would like to forecast the churn of their clients.

**Business Problem Statement**: The company wants to forecast which users are planning to leave

**Business Value**: To ensure loyalty, those who are going to leave, will be offered with promotional codes.

Churn (or churn rate) is number of customers disconnecting their service over a given time period

In term of a machine learning problem our goal is to classify each client into one of two groups:



* Loyal customers who won’t churn
* Customers who will churn in the future

**Dataset**

The data consists of files obtained from different source:



* Contract.csv - contract information
* Personal.csv - The client’s personal data
* Internet.csv - information about Internet services
* Phone.csv - Information about telephone services

The customerID column contains a unique code assigned to each client.

**Target** is in the EndDate column.
