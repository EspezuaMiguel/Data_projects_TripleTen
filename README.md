| [Movie Score](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Working%20with%20Data%20in%20Python) | Investigated the impact of the number of votes on IMDb ratings for TV shows during the "Golden Age" of television. |
| [Grocery Analysis Data](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis(EDA)) | Analyzed Instacart data to understand customer behavior and preferences in grocery shopping. |
| [Telecom Plans Analysis](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Statistical%20Data%20Analysis) | Examined user behavior to determine the profitability of different telecom packages. |
| [Video Game Analysis](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Integrated%20Project%201) | Assessed the success of video games in various regions to identify potential high-sales markets. |
| [Taxi Ride](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Data%20Collection%20and%20Storage%20(SQL)) | Analyzed factors influencing taxi prices to optimize advertising strategies for vehicle sales. |
| [Mobile Carrier Classification](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning) | Evaluated revenue generated by prepaid plans to inform advertising budget adjustments for a telecom operator. |
| [Bank Customer Leaving](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning) | Forecasted customer churn for a bank based on historical data on client actions and contract terminations. |
| [Oily Giant](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20in%20Business) | Analyzed data from multiple oil resource areas to compute profits and losses associated with establishing new extraction regions. |
| [Gold Extraction](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Integrated%20Project%202) | Developed a machine learning algorithm to forecast gold extraction quantities for production efficiency improvement. |
| [The Sure Tomorrow Insurance Company](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Linear%20Algebra) | Built a machine learning algorithm to identify customers with similar risk profiles while preserving model robustness against data obfuscation. |
| [Rusty Bargain Predict Value](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Numerical%20Methods) | Developed a predictive car market value feature using historical data to enhance an application's functionality. |
| [Taxi Order](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Time%20Series) | Constructed a forecasting model to predict taxi bookings for the upcoming hour using historical data. |
| [Movie Reviews](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Texts) | Developed a sentiment analysis system for movie reviews to effectively filter and classify sentiments expressed. |
| [Age Detection](https://github.com/EspezuaMiguel/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Computer%20Vision) | Trained a model to autonomously identify a patron's age at a point of sale using computer vision. |
| Client Churn Model | Implemented a classification model to forecast client churn. |

These projects provided valuable hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling, preparing me for real-world challenges in the field of data science.
